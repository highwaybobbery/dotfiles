## Language Preferences

- When creating new scripts, prefer to use Ruby unless Bash is a much better approach. Other languages (Node, JavaScript, Python, Perl) are also options but need a very clear reason

## Script Creation Workflow

- When creating a new script, confirm with me that I want to make it executable, and that I want to make an alias in local dotfiles, to make the command globally available

## Repository Handling

- When I ask you about a repo with just the owner/repo_name, first look in the repos.yml to determine if it is locally available
